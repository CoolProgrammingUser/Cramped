        <p>
            I'd say I have quite an affinity for programming (in case you didn't notice while you were using a website I made from scratch). As a result, I've accumulated a large number of websites and programs. I've referenced some of these in other sections, but this puts everything in one, convenient place. The headings within each category can be clicked on to visit the page or download the program (App Inventor and Python stuff downloads, the rest brings up a new tab).
        <div id="sections">

            <p>
                For a project in 10<sup>th</sup> grade, one of my teachers had us use this free Google service to put together a research topic of our choice. After discovering this means of making my work available to the world, I naturally had to make use of it for my own various purposes.

                Starting some time in middle school, I decided that I was tired of relying on years' worth of saved-up money and maybe the occasional birthday or Christmas present to provide me with spending power (which I basically never made use of). Rather than being a loser and getting a real job, I decided to go into business for myself. I started off small but slowly became more successful. Right now, my business is on hiatus, but I plan on bringing it back (again) bigger and better than before. Until then (and after then) you can see the website I made for it.

                This is the source of this amazing website. I figured out how to make use of the website capabilities of this website just a few months ago, and due to my sudden ability to use it, my knowledge of JavaScript has increased exponetially.
