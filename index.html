            Welcome to the repository of my essence. I created this website in an effort to provide a clearer picture of what type of person I am for my application to MIT. Here, you will find things I've done, circumstances I've experienced, and nerdiness I've acquired. Although I think time will prevent me from realizing my plans for this website in their entirety before the opportunity for this to influence my application expires, I'm pretty confident that I can address the most important aspects of my life. Regardless of any of that, I plan on continuing to expand this website indefinitely because I like how it concentrates everything cool about me into one place. You might even describe this as me in a nutshell.
