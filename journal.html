                This is my first full day back at college after winter break, and I thought I'd finally get to work typing some stuff. Although I want to just say I have a bunch of stuff to do and be done, I'll include a list of the majority of the stuff (including some of the things I've already done):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Go to the student health services office.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Get my computer's space bar fixed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do stuff about jury duty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scout out my classes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scout out my SAT subject tests' testing location (near Harvard).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Email my work-study job when I'm coming back and at what times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    See how many pull-ups I can do after becoming a wimp over break.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Color-code my printed-up classes schedule.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Look up what materials my classes need.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Just to be clear, that's all the stuff I need to do <em>today</em>; I left out the other stuff that I should be doing but won't have time for. Also, I hope you aren't waiting for me to give that list a context because you're going to be disappointed; I might expand on some of the stuff later, and I would imagine future entries will be better (if only because I'd feel bad for doing the same thing every time), but for now, I need to be done.
            </p>

                Today I had to wake up way too early (&asymp;4:30) for my SAT subject tests (for MIT!). Although I'm sure for freshman admission last year the testing requirements for MIT were ACT + writing <em>or</em> SAT test and SAT subject tests, apparently things are different this year for transferring (even though one of the people who works in the admissions office tried to tell me that it's always been this way, even for freshman). As a result, I needed to pay a bunch of money to take the necessary math and science subject tests. Because I had to wake up so early, I had to steal some food from the dining hall yesterday so I could eat breakfast before 7:00. I don't know who decided that having important tests so early in the morning is a good idea, but they were most certainly wrong. On the bright side (or more exactly, the dark side because that's what it was outside), I had no trouble fitting on the T and getting to my testing location. Something that I didn't expect to happen was that, as I walking to the classroom I was going to have my test in, one person asked me if I was a BU student and proceeded to tell me how they thought they were in the same biology class as me. I didn't recognize them (or understand what they were doing taking an SAT subject test), but it's ridiculous how often people recognize me. There's a lot more I could say on the subject, but I need to move on.
            </p>

                I suppose the test went as you would expect any other standardized test to go: lots of structure, lots of quiet, and lots of questions. I particularly had fun trying to salvage my knowledge of cursive to copy a statement which was far too long. Although there were questions I had to skip, I'd say I felt fairly confident about the ones I answered. Don't worry, though, if the scores come back as less-than-satisfactory, I'll be sure to come up with some reason for it that I'll put in the Excuses section of this website. I'm not excessively worried, though, because apparently, you can flunk the SAT subject tests and still get a 200 and you can get the top score of 800 without getting all of the answers correct! Initially, I was intimidated by the average SAT scores MIT students get on the tests, but apparently, there's a lot of nonsense going on with the scoring, so it's not quite as scary anymore. At least the ACT test has the excuse of not having enough points to give away to be able to represent each question. Anyway, there are more things to talk about than that.

                After the test, I gave myself a moderately brief self-guided tour around Harvard. I have to say that I don't think Harvard is as cool as MIT. (Now I'm sure to get in.) For one thing, the huge gate encompassing Harvard Yard makes me feel unwelcome. Besides that, they make the NO TRESPASSING signs into the buildings more visible than MIT. I don't think the insides of the buildings are as cool either (or at least don't have as many signs talking about cool stuff). Although there are some impressively designed buildings around Harvard, something about how the the all-brick buildings are designed makes me associate them with formality and elitism (although I can't speak for what the people are like) whereas MIT makes me think of creativity and experimentation. I didn't want to stay too long at Harvard, though, so I made my way back to the immensely crowded T and home (if that's what you call a dorm room).

                The rest of my day was less productive than I had hoped (as is every day).
