                This is my first full day back at college after winter break, and I thought I'd finally get to work typing some stuff. Although I want to just say I have a bunch of stuff to do and be done, I'll include a list of the majority of the stuff (including some of the things I've already done):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Go to the student health services office.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Get my computer's space bar fixed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do stuff about jury duty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scout out my classes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scout out my SAT subject tests' testing location (near Harvard).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Email my work-study job when I'm coming back and at what times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    See how many pull-ups I can do after becoming a wimp over break.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Color-code my printed-up classes schedule.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Look up what materials my classes need.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Just to be clear, that's all the stuff I need to do <em>today</em>; I left out the other stuff that I should be doing but won't have time for. Also, I hope you aren't waiting for me to give that list a context because you're going to be disappointed; I might expand on some of the stuff later, and I would imagine future entries will be better (if only because I'd feel bad for doing the same thing every time), but for now, I need to be done.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Today I had to wake up way too early (&asymp;4:30) for my SAT subject tests (for MIT!). Although I'm sure for freshman admission last year the testing requirements for MIT were ACT + writing <em>or</em> SAT test and SAT subject tests, apparently things are different this year for transferring (even though one of the people who works in the admissions office tried to tell me that it's always been this way, even for freshman). As a result, I needed to pay a bunch of money to take the necessary math and science subject tests. Because I had to wake up so early, I had to steal some food from the dining hall yesterday so I could eat breakfast before 7:00. I don't know who decided that having important tests so early in the morning is a good idea, but they were most certainly wrong. On the bright side (or more exactly, the dark side because that's what it was outside), I had no trouble fitting on the T and getting to my testing location. Something that I didn't expect to happen was that, as I walking to the classroom I was going to have my test in, one person asked me if I was a BU student and proceeded to tell me how they thought they were in the same biology class as me. I didn't recognize them (or understand what they were doing taking an SAT subject test), but it's ridiculous how often people recognize me. There's a lot more I could say on the subject, but I need to move on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I suppose the test went as you would expect any other standardized test to go: lots of structure, lots of quiet, and lots of questions. I particularly had fun trying to salvage my knowledge of cursive to copy a statement which was far too long. Although there were questions I had to skip, I'd say I felt fairly confident about the ones I answered. Don't worry, though, if the scores come back as less-than-satisfactory, I'll be sure to come up with some reason for it that I'll put in the Excuses section of this website. I'm not excessively worried, though, because apparently, you can flunk the SAT subject tests and still get a 200 and you can get the top score of 800 without getting all of the answers correct! Initially, I was intimidated by the average SAT scores MIT students get on the tests, but apparently, there's a lot of nonsense going on with the scoring, so it's not quite as scary anymore. At least the ACT test has the excuse of not having enough points to give away to be able to represent each question. Anyway, there are more things to talk about than that.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the test, I gave myself a moderately brief self-guided tour around Harvard. I have to say that I don't think Harvard is as cool as MIT. (Now I'm sure to get in.) For one thing, the huge gate encompassing Harvard Yard makes me feel unwelcome. Besides that, they make the NO TRESPASSING signs into the buildings more visible than MIT. I don't think the insides of the buildings are as cool either (or at least don't have as many signs talking about cool stuff). Although there are some impressively designed buildings around Harvard, something about how the the all-brick buildings are designed makes me associate them with formality and elitism (although I can't speak for what the people are like) whereas MIT makes me think of creativity and experimentation. I didn't want to stay too long at Harvard, though, so I made my way back to the immensely crowded T and home (if that's what you call a dorm room).
            </p>
            <p>
                The rest of my day was less productive than I had hoped (as is every day). I did my laundry today which is something I would have done yesterday, but then I realized when I'd have to be getting up, and I quickly decided against it. I got a foreign coin out of the experience, so it wasn't too bad. During and after that, I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to format seemingly simple things for this website in the way I wanted. It's quite annoying how even the simplest formatting or behavior takes an immense amount of time to create from scratch; I'd say there's at least a minimum of one hour invested in absolutely every single feature of this website with the higher end being something like 20-30+ hours. It wouldn't be too bad if this were the only thing I had to do (because I like programming), but such is not the case. I would condemn the frequency with which I get distracted from doing more necessary work, but when I think about all the cool things I've done, I also think that a good 95% of them wouldn't have been done at all if I hadn't had a lapse in my better judgement and worked on something much less important. Naturally, it's still important to actually do the necessary work, and I'm working really hard on trying to find that balance, but I'd say distractions can have their place. However, this distraction needs to come to a close; I have a lot of work to do tomorrow (which is pretty much the normal state), and I like to at least pretend like I'll be able to focus on it completely and get it all finished in time.

                There were a lot of interesting things that happened today; however, due to how ridiculously late it is, I'm only going to be able to provide you with summarized versions (even though they may seem like the long versions). Since it would take too much effort for me to decide how transition in and out of each paragraph, I'm just going to list each event in order and try to provide enough background for it to make sense.

                    My roommate finally shut the window. For reasons I consider largely insufficient, my roommate has insisted that the window be kept open all the time despite the fact that it's the middle of winter; I was on board with keeping the window open in the summer since there's no air conditioning, but it just doesn't make sense anymore. For the record, we get along quite well, and I've always gone on the assumption that, if I insisted earnestly enough, he would shut the window, but it had always been just barely warm enough that I didn't want to put my foot down. Last night, I had quite a difficult time keeping myself warm in bed, and later on, I woke up presumably because I was tense and having a hard time keeping myself warm. For the first time, I decided to break out the thicker blanket I had stashed away in an effort to keep myself warm. I slept quite nicely after that. When my alarm told me it was time to take on the day, I noticed that my roommate was awake (he's almost always awake before me) and the window was closed. Apparently he saw what great lengths I went through to keep warm, felt bad, and decided to close the window. Even though the window is shut right now, you would hardly know it based on how strong of a breeze is still coming through the sides. I'm uncertain what the future holds with regards to the opening of the window.

                    My professors started explaining concepts I had been wondering about for a long time. By in large, I understand what's going on with whatever is taught to me, but occasionally, there's one or two things that I would prefer some elaboration on, but I'm often still stuck with the simple version. Today, things seemed to take a rare shift for the moment, but I need more time before I can tell if it actually turns into anything. Beyond that, it's too abstract for me to be able to effectively talk about, so I'll move on.

                    I went to a non-existent class. My Calculus discussion was scheduled for today, but when I went to where it was, all I found was one person in an otherwise empty room. Soon enough the person found out and told me that the discussion had been moved to Thursday. For one thing, I couldn't find anything that said what must have been an obvious fact to everyone else in the class that things had been changed. For another thing, I don't have room in my schedule for a class at the same time (I assume) on Thursday. To make things even better, the discussion section is where we're supposed to turn in our homework. I emailed the professor about what's going on, but I have yet to receive a response.

                    I had brownies. There's a professor who lives in my building with her husband, and every Monday, she cooks a bunch of brownies for whoever wants to come by and get them. Obviously, brownies aren't meant to be passed up, so I had been going there a while, and I returned today. We just talked, and other people came by and they talked. Eventually I left to face the slowly mounting pile of work which I never make enough progress on.

                The week has finally come to an end. Hopefully, I'll be more prepared to take on next week because I'm not a fan of the miniscule amount of sleep I've been getting. I thought I'd have more to say today, but somehow, everything I wanted to say has gone away. I'm not complaining, though: I need to focus on getting to bed. My goal this weekend is to sleep and then try to keep on top of my homework inbetween typing up at least a large portion of the essays for my transfer application to MIT. Next time, I'll try to talk about something other than how tired I am all the time.

                Guess what? I'm going to talk about how tired I am. I would have tried to avoid it, but the events that transpired today make it impossible. What events, you ask? Well, the main one is how I woke up today when I should have been in my lab: Last night, I was up way too late (even later than normal) trying to finish a massive amount of homework that had accumulated, and it was going well into the early morning hours. Eventually, I decided that an hour more or less working on my homework wasn't going to make much of a difference, so I tried to get at least an hour of sleep in before I had to wake up at 7:00 to make my 9 o'clock lab. I got three hours of sleep. For reasons beyond my comprehension, I woke up without my alarm clock, and as I stared at the time, it took me a little while before I could process that it was after 9:00 and I was just waking up. Confused as to how this could happen, I spotted my alarm clock next to me in bed, and it was turned off. This isn't the first time this sort of thing happened: Last semester, even though I always hit "snooze" instead of turning my alarm clock off just in case I fall back asleep and need to be woken up again, I made the mistake of bringing the clock closer to me, so I could hit snooze more easily, and I was tired enough to not get up by the time it stopped going off after an hour; I missed my lab that day. (It's always the labs.) To ensure that I didn't repeat the experience, I resolved to hit snooze until I'm fully awake <em>and</em> leave the alarm clock where it is at the end of my bed even though it's more inconvenient (which is the point). I've stayed true to that resolution, but somehow, today, without me remembering it, I faltered. I got to the lab as quickly as I could (an hour late), and by some miracle, I was still allowed to participate. Really, I don't know what else I can do to make sure I wake up when I need to: I thought I had a solid plan, but it still got sabotaged. I suppose I can try to set my phone's alarm as well (which I might do), but I shouldn't have to. I don't know what happened; all I know is that I don't want it to happen again.
            </p>

                There's a few more things I could talk about, but time is precious, so I'll just say that Google didn't have a doodle for Groundhog's Day today, and I find it quite disappointing.

                    The New England Patriots won the Super Bowl. I've never been much of a sports person, but apparently I'm in the minority here. There was a big Super Bowl party in the study/theater room which I visited briefly, but I spent most of the time doing stuff in my room. I could tell when the Super Bowl was over and what the outcome was when I could hear extensive (happy) screaming from miles around through my window. Apparently, the Patriots came back from a huge score deficit to pull out a win at the very end. Two days later, despite less-than-ideal weather, there was a huge parade through Boston (which I didn't see).

                    I finally got to participate in one (of three) of the clubs I tried joining at the beginning of the year. As it turned out, I had class during the time the club met last semester (like the other two), so I couldn't ever go; this semester, my schedule had that space open. To be completely honest, I kind-of expected more from the club (more people, cooler stuff, ...), but it wasn't too bad. One cool thing we did was make ice cream with liquid nitrogen. (I can only imagine how much ice cream MIT could make with all of the liquid nitrogen it has lying around.) It was all pretty low-key, and not much was expected from me. One thing I found interesting was how they were a sneaky type of inviting: No one singled me out or even acknowledged I was new (despite the fact that there were far too few people to not notice new arrivals), and any sort of interaction was casual, as if we had known each other for a long time; it was an interesting experience, and I kind-of like that way of welcoming new people. There's a pretty good chance I'll go to their next meeting.

                As is always the case, I have stuff to do which prevents me from elaborating as much as I'd like, the main thing being finishing the actual application for MIT. Although I'd consider this better than the real application if only for the ability to elaborate on the spot-on essay topic choices (found <a target="_self" href="stories#The Happy Birthday Song">here</a> and <a target="_self" href="moments#Extreme Lonliness">here</a>), it doesn't matter how cool this is if I don't make a submission with their form. I also have 3 tests on Monday that I should study for and homework due at various times, but considering how the application to MIT is due Wednesday, it takes priority.

                I would have liked to have made more entries before this one, but after completing the application to MIT on February 15 and finishing up the more important parts of this website, doing the perpetually immense amount of homework I had overtook this in importance. When I noticed it on May 7, or more exactly, on May 4, I was denied transfer admission to MIT. The only conceivable way in my mind that I could have been denied is that my standardized test scores were too low (which isn't too unreasonable when you compare my scores to the ones people at MIT have): I had tons of awards; I aced the essays (as much as you can with so little space); I had good grades; and you can't top including a website as awesome as this. The only imperfection in my portrayal as the perfect candidate was in my test scores (and maybe in my activities but the stuff I did wasn't necessarily pathetic so much as it was unconventional). I'm a little disappointed, but I put everything I had into that application and exhausted myself doing it. If they don't want me, that's their loss; I'll be cool without them. Besides, one thing MIT is notorious for is giving out tons of homework, and I haven't really been able to keep up with the homework given out at Boston University. As a matter of fact, I was seriously considering the possibility of needing to decline a hypothetical acceptance into MIT solely because of the homework: Regardless of how well I understand something, I invariably take a long time to do problems, and if anything, that consumed time hinders my education, not advances it. Having a bunch of homework has always caused issues with me, and this last semester has been especially miserable: I've gotten a <a target="_self" href="experiments#Amount of sleep">terrible amount of sleep</a>; I hardly learned anything; I almost failed two classes (naturally, the ones most necessary to my biology major); and my GPA has gotten dangerously close to disqualifying me from thousands of dollars of financial aid. I can't afford to go someplace that dishes out a lot of homework.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next, most logical follow-up to this is what am I going to do now? At this point in time, I don't have all of the details worked out, but there is a general direction. The first thing I'm doing is figuring out what college I'm transferring to: Boston University is far too expensive, and I'm not sure if I could rebound from another year of awful homework anyway. If I decide fast enough (May 31) and discover they'll allow pass/fail grades to count towards my major, I can have at least my worst grade from last semester converted and therefore removed from my GPA, raising it. I don't think my college prospects have been ruined quite yet, but I have to keep on top of things to make sure it stays that way. In less stressful news, I'm going to be using this summer to jumpstart <a target="_self" href="projects#My business">my business</a>: Spending so much time on this and other websites has given me great confidence that I can make a bunch of money off of making websites (although I plan on expanding to other things as well). I have everything all laid out in my head, and I'm hoping to become successful enough to be able to put something public together for the eclipse on August 21.
            </p>

                I think this is going to be the last entry in this mini journal. I could easily go on and on about various things that happen in my life, but that's what my real journal is for. I hope this has provided you with a small glimpse of my personality in day-to-day life.
