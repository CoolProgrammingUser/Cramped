            <p>
                This is my first full day back at college after winter break, and I thought I'd finally get to work typing some stuff. Although I want to just say I have a bunch of stuff to do and be done, I'll include a list of the majority of the stuff (including some of the things I've already done):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Go to the student health services office.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Get my computer's space bar fixed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do stuff about jury duty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scout out my classes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scout out my SAT subject tests' testing location (near Harvard).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Email my work-study job when I'm coming back and at what times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    See how many pull-ups I can do after becoming a wimp over break.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Color-code my printed-up classes schedule.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Look up what materials my classes need.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Just to be clear, that's all the stuff I need to do <em>today</em>; I left out the other stuff that I should be doing but won't have time for. Also, I hope you aren't waiting for me to give that list a context because you're going to be disappointed; I might expand on some of the stuff later, and I would imagine future entries will be better (if only because I'd feel bad for doing the same thing every time), but for now, I need to be done.
            </p>
