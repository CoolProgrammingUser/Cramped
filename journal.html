                This is my first full day back at college after winter break, and I thought I'd finally get to work typing some stuff. Although I want to just say I have a bunch of stuff to do and be done, I'll include a list of the majority of the stuff (including some of the things I've already done):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Go to the student health services office.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Get my computer's space bar fixed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do stuff about jury duty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scout out my classes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scout out my SAT subject tests' testing location (near Harvard).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Email my work-study job when I'm coming back and at what times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    See how many pull-ups I can do after becoming a wimp over break.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Color-code my printed-up classes schedule.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Look up what materials my classes need.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Just to be clear, that's all the stuff I need to do <em>today</em>; I left out the other stuff that I should be doing but won't have time for. Also, I hope you aren't waiting for me to give that list a context because you're going to be disappointed; I might expand on some of the stuff later, and I would imagine future entries will be better (if only because I'd feel bad for doing the same thing every time), but for now, I need to be done.
            </p>

                Today I had to wake up way too early (&asymp;4:30) for my SAT subject tests (for MIT!). Although I'm sure for freshman admission last year the testing requirements for MIT were ACT + writing <em>or</em> SAT test and SAT subject tests, apparently things are different this year for transferring (even though one of the people who works in the admissions office tried to tell me that it's always been this way, even for freshman). As a result, I needed to pay a bunch of money to take the necessary math and science subject tests. Because I had to wake up so early, I had to steal some food from the dining hall yesterday so I could eat breakfast before 7:00. I don't know who decided that having important tests so early in the morning is a good idea, but they were most certainly wrong. On the bright side (or more exactly, the dark side because that's what it was outside), I had no trouble fitting on the T and getting to my testing location. Something that I didn't expect to happen was that, as I walking to the classroom I was going to have my test in, one person asked me if I was a BU student and proceeded to tell me how they thought they were in the same biology class as me. I didn't recognize them (or understand what they were doing taking an SAT subject test), but it's ridiculous how often people recognize me. There's a lot more I could say on the subject, but I need to move on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I suppose the test went as you would expect any other standardized test to go: lots of structure, lots of quiet, and lots of questions. I particularly had fun trying to salvage my knowledge of cursive to copy a statement which was far too long. Although there were questions I had to skip, I'd say I felt fairly confident about the ones I answered. Don't worry, though, if the scores come back as less-than-satisfactory, I'll be sure to come up with some reason for it that I'll put in the Excuses section of this website. I'm not excessively worried, though, because apparently, you can flunk the SAT subject tests and still get a 200 and you can get the top score of 800 without getting all of the answers correct! Initially, I was intimidated by the average SAT scores MIT students get on the tests, but apparently, there's a lot of nonsense going on with the scoring, so it's not quite as scary anymore. At least the ACT test has the excuse of not having enough points to give away to be able to represent each question. Anyway, there are more things to talk about than that.

                After the test, I gave myself a moderately brief self-guided tour around Harvard. I have to say that I don't think Harvard is as cool as MIT. (Now I'm sure to get in.) For one thing, the huge gate encompassing Harvard Yard makes me feel unwelcome. Besides that, they make the NO TRESPASSING signs into the buildings more visible than MIT. I don't think the insides of the buildings are as cool either (or at least don't have as many signs talking about cool stuff). Although there are some impressively designed buildings around Harvard, something about how the the all-brick buildings are designed makes me associate them with formality and elitism (although I can't speak for what the people are like) whereas MIT makes me think of creativity and experimentation. I didn't want to stay too long at Harvard, though, so I made my way back to the immensely crowded T and home (if that's what you call a dorm room).

                The rest of my day was less productive than I had hoped (as is every day). I did my laundry today which is something I would have done yesterday, but then I realized when I'd have to be getting up, and I quickly decided against it. I got a foreign coin out of the experience, so it wasn't too bad. During and after that, I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to format seemingly simple things for this website in the way I wanted. It's quite annoying how even the simplest formatting or behavior takes an immense amount of time to create from scratch; I'd say there's at least a minimum of one hour invested in absolutely every single feature of this website with the higher end being something like 20-30+ hours. It wouldn't be too bad if this were the only thing I had to do (because I like programming), but such is not the case. I would condemn the frequency with which I get distracted from doing more necessary work, but when I think about all the cool things I've done, I also think that a good 95% of them wouldn't have been done at all if I hadn't had a lapse in my better judgement and worked on something much less important. Naturally, it's still important to actually do the necessary work, and I'm working really hard on trying to find that balance, but I'd say distractions can have their place. However, this distraction needs to come to a close; I have a lot of work to do tomorrow (which is pretty much the normal state), and I like to at least pretend like I'll be able to focus on it completely and get it all fininshed in time.

                There were a lot of interesting things that happened today; however, due to how ridiculously late it is, I'm only going to be able to provide you with summarized versions (even though they may seem like the long versions). Since it would take too much effort for me to decide how transition in and out of each paragraph, I'm just going to list each event in order and try to provide enough background for it to make sense.

                    My roommate finally shut the window. For reasons I consider largely insufficient, my roommate has insisted that the window be kept open all the time despite the fact that it's the middle of winter; I was on board with keeping the window open in the summer since there's no air conditioning, but it just doesn't make sense anymore. For the record, we get along quite well, and I've always gone on the assumption that, if I insisted earnestly enough, he would shut the window, but it had always been just barely warm enough that I didn't want to put my foot down. Last night, I had quite a difficult time keeping myself warm in bed, and later on, I woke up presumably because I was tense and having a hard time keeping myself warm. For the first time, I decided to break out the thicker blanket I had stashed away in an effort to keep myself warm. I slept quite nicely after that. When my alarm told me it was time to take on the day, I noticed that my roommate was awake (he's almost always awake before me) and the window was closed. Apparently he saw what great lengths I went through to keep warm, felt bad, and decided to close the window. Even though the window is shut right now, you would hardly know it based on how strong of a breeze is still coming through the sides. I'm uncertain what the future holds with regards to the opening of the window.

                    My professors started explaining concepts I had been wondering about for a long time. By in large, I understand what's going on with whatever is taught to me, but occasionally, there's one or two things that I would prefer some elaboration on, but I'm often still stuck with the simple version. Today, things seemed to take a rare shift for the moment, but I need more time before I can tell if it actually turns into anything. Beyond that, it's too abstract for me to be able to effectively talk about, so I'll move on.

                    I went to a non-existent class. My Calculus discussion was scheduled for today, but when I went to where it was, all I found was one person in an otherwise empty room. Soon enough the person found out and told me that the discussion had been moved to Thursday. For one thing, I couldn't find anything that said what must have been an obvious fact to everyone else in the class that things had been changed. For another thing, I don't have room in my schedule for a class at the same time (I assume) on Thursday. To make things even better, the discussion section is where we're supposed to turn in our homework. I emailed the professor about what's going on, but I have yet to receive a response.

                    I had brownies. There's a professor who lives in my building with her husband, and every Monday, she cooks a bunch of brownies for whoever wants to come by and get them. Obviously, brownies aren't meant to be passed up, so I had been going there a while, and I returned today. We just talked, and other people came by and they talked. Eventually I left to face the slowly mounting pile of work which I never make enough progress on.
