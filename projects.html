                The Chairy Project

            <p>
                While sill a sophomore in high school, I came up with the perfect, most memorable, nondestructive, senior prank possible: removing all of the chairs from the school. During my senior year, I set out to make this dream a reality. Since I didn't want to get in trouble, my first step was writing persuasive essays to the principal (who was actually pretty nice). Regrettably, all that remains of my endeavor is the essays which I included below. However, I'd like to say for the record that it's not at all unlikely that I'll revisit this plan when I have more money that can take care of some of the concerns raised.

                Essay #1
            </h3>
            <p>
                Mr. Savauge, I realize that you were reluctant to go along with my crazy scheme, but I’d like to give you a more thorough idea of what I was planning in the hopes that I may slightly alter your opinion. I would appreciate it if you read this through (I know, it’s intimidating), and I think I could offer you some very persuasive information while explaining my very well-thought-out plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let me start off by explaining something that I’m sure you’re all too familiar with. Throughout high school, people follow a rigid routine of going to classes day in and day out; time drags on, and people become antsy. By the time people become seniors, they start looking back on their nearly-finished high school career and get the feeling that they need to have something that they can be remembered by. Surely you can remember your time as a senior and that desire to make something out of your time left. It’s almost a universal truth that seniors need a way to express themselves in a memorable way before they take that great leap into the real world. As I’m also sure you’re all too familiar with, many people end up making that expression destructive. It takes careful planning and vigilance to ensure that something can make a satisfying impact while not causing things to take a wrong turn. I firmly believe that my plan quite adequately fulfills those requirements and that I’m more than capable of seeing that things go smoothly. As for my plan, I’ll skip the general idea (taking all of the chairs out of the building and decorating) and just get right into how I’ll solve the problems and optimize the performance of this enormous undertaking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Immediately following getting you on board, one thing I’d like to do is give you a full description of my intentions which could be sent to all staff members via a mass email (I suppose I could do something similar myself, but it would be so much easier to send it by a mass email). Depending on their response, I could do a number of things. These things could include (but are not limited to):
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Treating their chairs in a special way
                </li>
                <li>
                    Only rearranging their chairs
                </li>
                <li>
                    Skipping their room altogether if absolutely necessary
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Naturally, I’d like it if everyone agreed to the full extent of the plans, but I’m willing to make concessions for the good of the project. With the input of the staff, I could find days to go through with the project that wouldn’t negatively affect their plans, and I could also find out places to put the chairs that would have minimal interference I’ll talk more about placement of the chairs later).
            </p>
            <p>
                The next thing I’d want to do is create some sort of senior pride club (I’m open to sponsor suggestions). Using this organization, the details of this project could be significantly refined. Furthermore, the environment would be conducive to ironing out any problems that may seep through this iron-clad plan as well as fundraising for various supplies. Recruiting would also be a lot easier. Just to be clear, I’d still like to form the club even if you somehow decide against approving the project; it would still be cool to come up with ways to prove to everyone what they already know: Seniors are the best.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most intimidating problems of the Chairy Project is how I would manage to remove the chairs in a quick, effective way. Over time, I’ve added on to my method, and it has reached a point of extreme efficiency. Firstly, I would have everyone (hopefully a large amount of people) gathered in a group outside the school, so I could assign duties and give instructions. Next, certain people in charge of their respective group(s) would receive walkie-talkies for better coordination. People would go through one room at a time and label the chairs with Post-It notes or duct tape or something with the number of the room it’ll be coming out of (possibly all at once or one smaller group doing it before the chairs are taken). Afterwards, the people would take the chairs out one or two doors (depending on how crowded it gets), and there would be at least one or two people who I would have briefed on where to put the chairs who would guide people to the correct destination. Depending on whether it’s found to be necessary, the chairs may be turned upside down or something in order to prevent them from toppling over and ending up in a place that they shouldn’t be. I would be constantly patrolling the group making sure everything runs smoothly (and probably helping too). Following the one day of glory, I would get everyone who helped take the chairs out to bring them back in: I know I’d have a harder time getting people to come back, but I think I could get the majority, and I’ll come back alone if I have to; it would still be worth it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another thing that I’m sure tops your list of fears is how the chairs will be returned in the same condition as they left. Starting with the easier stuff, I’ll make sure that the Chairy Project is only done on a good-weather day; that way, water damage can be avoided, and the chairs get very little mud on them if at all. Also, on their way back into the school, the chairs can be checked and wiped of any dirt or bugs. In terms of vandalism, I have two ideas, and possibly more to come: Since one task of the Chairy Project would be fundraising, there would be the possibility of renting some sort of lockable storage containers. Another option would be to hire a few people (not students) to do a night watch to insure that no delinquents decide to take the project too far. With the help of a club of people to bounce ideas off of, I’m sure that a satisfactory solution can be found if you wouldn’t consider this one. If you’re worried about something happening while everyone is taking the chairs out (such as people writing inappropriate things on the classroom boards), I could have a small number of trustworthy people watch over the proceedings, and I would actually encourage you to be there so you could be put at ease and we could be sure that we’re doing everything right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although it’s not really a problem, I feel that it’s necessary to tell you when I’d be thinking of carrying this out. Under my current plan, the chairs will be taken out the Sunday before the first Monday of April; if the weather is a problem, it would be consecutively moved to the next Sunday until there are favorable conditions. I picked this day for a few reasons: First, I picked April because it’s fairly late in the year (so the seniors can go out with a bang instead of anticlimactically start off with one), it gives the teachers ample time to prepare, it gives plenty of time for the project to be organized and refined, and it’s not so late in the year that it begins to interfere with testing. As for why I picked Monday, it allows people to see the fruits of their labor in all of their classes and there’s not usually much crucial going on in class like tests due to the shorter time period. The time, like everything else, is flexible, but that’s the current plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you’re worried about the feasibility of the Chairy Project, you can rest assured that I’ll make this work (or maybe that’s the thing you’re worried about). I can’t imagine any better way of ending my high school career than by pulling this off; you can’t really get any better than that. I will keep track of every problem, come up with solutions, run those solutions by you, and make sure that everything goes smoothly. There’s the saying, “When there’s a will, there’s a way,” and I have a lot of will. I know I can’t possibly give a solution to every concern you have about this project in this otherwise extremely well-written persuasive essay, but you don’t have to give your permission to go through with it right now: All I’m asking for is the chance to prove that I can pull it off. When stripped down to its simplest form, I don’t think the Chairy Project is all that malicious: Taking the chairs out of the classrooms doesn’t really pose much of an impediment to learning (although somewhat distracting), and since it would only be for one day, I think it wouldn’t be too bad of a light-hearted joke: It’s only the details that go along with the project which actually start raising concerns. If you still have concerns at the end of this (which you probably will), don’t use it a reason to shoot the whole thing down; tell me about it. I can only work on problems if I know about them, and I feel extremely confident that I’ll be able to some up with satisfactory solutions with plenty of time to spare. Furthermore, if I didn’t come up with solutions in time, it wouldn’t be like, “Oh, that stinks. Oh well,” and then go through with it anyway; if I don’t come up with solutions in time, I’ll shut the whole thing down myself, and you wouldn’t have anything to worry about. You have plenty of time to tell me that I can’t go through with this in the future, but there’s only so much time for me to begin setting things into motion. I’m only asking you to entertain the notion for the time being, so I can clean up anything that may still need work.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, I think the Chairy Project would be a very fun and nondestructive way for seniors to express themselves, and I hope that you give me the opportunity to show you such. You don’t have to approve me going through with it right now, just allow me to set things in motion, so I can prove to you that I can make it work. I know it would mean a lot to me, and I’m sure it would mean a lot to the class of 2016 as well.

                Essay #2
            </h3>
            <p>
                As is the case with any great vision, questions arise regarding the feasibility of such a grand scheme. Can enough money be raised? Can enough people be recruited? Can it be done in a reasonable time frame? It’s only natural that people should wonder such things, but it has become increasingly apparent to me that the Chairy Project (once again, name change pending)<note>In the original title of this essay, it said the Chairy Project with "name change pending" in parentheses. I don't quite remember why the name "Chairy Project" lost favor with me, but I think it's a pretty good name at this point in time; the only thing I might try to change is the "Project" part, but I don't know what would replace it.</note> is quite within our reach given enough determination.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the interests of putting things in an order that doesn’t introduce things you haven’t accepted yet, I’ll start by addressing the fundraising. Raising money significantly improves the chances of the Chairy Project being successful, and I’ve thought of multiple ways to fill our needs. The easiest of these methods is doing Internet crowdfunding. Many websites such as Kickstarter and GoFundMe are devoted to gathering money for projects of interest to people, and they would be great platforms for accumulating the necessary funds. I think you can agree that it shouldn’t be too hard to build sufficient interest. As a second way of getting funding, I, along with other more outgoing people, can patrol the streets raising awareness of the general idea of our cause (but not enough to put the surprise in jeopardy). Also, we may be able to put an ad out in the newspaper and/or put up posters around town. Finally, I plan on rejuvenating my mediocre (for now) business with things that I think could highly increase income for me, and after all, what good is extra money if I can’t spend it on pursuits as worthy as this?
            </p>
            <p>
                The next formidable impediment is finding people to participate. This would be largely dependent on local recruitment; however, steps can be taken to make that much less of an unknown. The first thing to do is expand the pool of eligible participants to anyone around town (from seniors up). I realize that it’s quite possible that just the senior class wouldn’t be enough to finish the project in a timely fashion, so the natural solution is to make it possible for others to help. How do I expect to lure so many people into doing work? It’s all about strategy. I’m under no illusions that people are going to be willing to flock to the school to do work when they have “better” things to do, no matter the reason. In an effort to compensate, I would provide incentives to participants. The most obvious thing to do is provide food. If there’s only one thing I’ve learned in my time at school, it’s that people, particularly high schoolers, will do just about anything for food. There’s nothing like the promise of a full belly to get people to do things. Although, I could stop right there since that almost certainly covers the problem of help, I’ll throw in some other things to make it even more convincing: Other forms of incentive could be raffles and small consolation prizes. These are excluding the inherent incentives of being with friends and being part of something people will talk about for years to come; it would be a fun event.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here comes the part that I’m sure you’re the most interested in: How will I pull everything together to get it done in a reasonable time frame? I’ve considered a multitude of variables and composed the formula on the next page. I also described a more specific method of moving the chairs. By substituting values for their corresponding variable, you’ll get the number of hours to complete the project. For simplicity and due to some things being easier to predict, I only alter the number of people to get the different times. You can feel free to change whatever you like if you’re curious about how things would turn out under different circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
                My basic plan for moving the chairs is as follows: Everyone would get something like a tarp which would be put underneath the chairs, and in turn, make them easier to push across the floor. There would be boards placed on part of the staircases which would act as a ramp to push the chairs down and even increase safety (along with the people stationed at the stairwells).
            </p>
            <p>
                t = [(c÷r÷p)(d÷v<sub>1</sub> + d÷v<sub>2</sub> + x) + b] ÷ 3600
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    t = the amount of time in hours
                </li>
                <li>
                    c = the amount of chairs in the school
                </li>
                <li>
                    r = the average percentage of people working (at a given time)

                <li>
                    p = the number of people
                </li>
                <li>
                    d = the average distance needed to travel one way in feet
                </li>
                <li>
                    v<sub>1</sub> = the speed of travel while the chairs are being moved in feet per second
                </li>
                <li>
                    v<sub>2</sub> = the speed of travel while the person is walking back in feet per second
                </li>
                <li>
                    x = the amount of time to prepare each chair to take in seconds
                </li>
                <li>
                    b = the amount of time needed to brief people before the project begins in seconds
                </li>
                <li>
                    3600 = not technically necessary but converts things into hours
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Now I’ll assign some values to the variables and try to explain my reasoning behind it.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    c = 1800 &rarr; about 60 classrooms with an average of 30 chairs each (I realize that the average might be a little higher, but some rooms don’t really have chairs, and others can be stacked effectively making them one)
                </li>
                <li>
                    r = 71.25% &rarr; 75% of people working at a given time (while the others rest) or everyone working at once and then resting for 25% of the time; 5% of the people on duty would be doing other jobs necessary for operation but which wouldn’t involve moving any chairs (I think the effective percentage can be increased, but I wanted to use numbers that would give me a good cushion.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    d = 1000 &rarr; I can’t imagine people ever needing to travel more than 3 football fields worth of distance to place their chairs (I’d like to see if there are places inside to put the chairs, so the average distance could be reduced.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    v<sub>1</sub> = 1 &rarr; I think people taking one second to push a chair one foot is pretty reasonable
                </li>
                <li>
                    v<sub>2</sub> = 4 &rarr; By my estimation, people take about three-foot steps and take one step in a little less than one second.
                </li>
                <li>
                    x = 30 &rarr; Preparing the chairs is pretty easy and shouldn't take more than a total of 30 seconds put a tarp underneath them (and take it out from underneath)
                </li>
                <li>
                    b = 900 &rarr; I think 15 minutes is a reasonable amount of time to inform people of the finer points of the project. (It might be nice to do it in the auditorium.)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="list">

                Although I think it's safe to say that you cited logistics as a way of discouraging me from pursuing this, determining exactly what it would take to make the Chairy Project possible has only strengthened my conviction that I can make it happen. I'd like to reiterate that I'm not asking for your approval of everything at this moment, I'd just like to know that you'll entertain the notion and allow me to work on and refine the plan (preferably with something like a senior pride club). Once again, if things don't work out, it can always be canceled, but there's only so much time to put things into motion. With proper diligence, planning, and positive attitude, this exciting fantasy can turn into a reality.

                How does MIT align with your goals (e.g., academic, personal, career, extracurricular, etc.)? (200-250 words)
            </p>
            <p>
                There isn't nearly enough room for me to describe the number of ways MIT aligns with my goals. It's no secret that MIT is known for its quality of education in the STEM field. Wouldn't it just so happen that that's where my interests lie. At one point, I was looking through the courses offered and found myself wanting to take all of them with an intensity proportional to the number of courses in that field. There's no place I know of that more closely parallels my interests and what I intend to pursue. In addition to that, there's no place I know of where you can get such a high-quality education in those areas. I want to make the biggest impact on the largest number of people, and that starts with learning as much as I can as thoroughly as I can. Furthermore, an education isn't achieved solely in the classroom, and a simple stroll through the hallways makes it abundantly clear that MIT does an excellent job of implementing its motto "Mens et Manus" whether through the countless labs and resources or the numerous opportunities for involvement. Something else a simple stroll will do is show you the creative and innovative culture thriving in this place of learning. I haven't come across any place that constructs such unique buildings, displays such intriguing artwork, and celebrates such legendary pranks. I can hardly imagine a better college to go to than MIT.

                Please discuss why you are considering transferring from your current college or university. (200-250 words)
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I wouldn't consider Boston University all that bad, there are a few reasons I think I should transfer. One of the biggest reasons is how well I think I'd fit into MIT, but I spent plenty of time talking about that in the first question; you can assume that just about every quality I mentioned is either not present or not as pronounced here. Another major factor is that I can't really afford to continue going to Boston University: A variety of circumstances and reasoning led to my attendance for this first year, but it doesn't make financial sense for me to continue into a second year. Aside from that, there are some things that I'd just prefer to have different. For example, there's a giant road running through the middle of Boston University, and I think it splits everything in half and takes away from the college community. In addition to that, I'm often eager to make or do something cool, but I find it hard to track down places that foster that (or at least places that aren't off-limits to me). Boston University has its good points, but I think it's best for me to look elsewhere for continuing my education.
