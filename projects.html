                Mr. Savauge, I realize that you were reluctant to go along with my crazy scheme, but I’d like to give you a more thorough idea of what I was planning in the hopes that I may slightly alter your opinion. I would appreciate it if you read this through (I know, it’s intimidating), and I think I could offer you some very persuasive information while explaining my very well-thought-out plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let me start off by explaining something that I’m sure you’re all too familiar with. Throughout high school, people follow a rigid routine of going to classes day in and day out; time drags on, and people become antsy. By the time people become seniors, they start looking back on their nearly-finished high school career and get the feeling that they need to have something that they can be remembered by. Surely you can remember your time as a senior and that desire to make something out of your time left. It’s almost a universal truth that seniors need a way to express themselves in a memorable way before they take that great leap into the real world. As I’m also sure you’re all too familiar with, many people end up making that expression destructive. It takes careful planning and vigilance to ensure that something can make a satisfying impact while not causing things to take a wrong turn. I firmly believe that my plan quite adequately fulfills those requirements and that I’m more than capable of seeing that things go smoothly. As for my plan, I’ll skip the general idea (taking all of the chairs out of the building and decorating) and just get right into how I’ll solve the problems and optimize the performance of this enormous undertaking.

                Immediately following getting you on board, one thing I’d like to do is give you a full description of my intentions which could be sent to all staff members via a mass email (I suppose I could do something similar myself, but it would be so much easier to send it by a mass email). Depending on their response, I could do a number of things. These things could include (but are not limited to):
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Treating their chairs in a special way
                </li>
                <li>
                    Only rearranging their chairs
                </li>
                <li>
                    Skipping their room altogether if absolutely necessary
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Naturally, I’d like it if everyone agreed to the full extent of the plans, but I’m willing to make concessions for the good of the project. With the input of the staff, I could find days to go through with the project that wouldn’t negatively affect their plans, and I could also find out places to put the chairs that would have minimal interference I’ll talk more about placement of the chairs later).
            </p>
            <p>
                The next thing I’d want to do is create some sort of senior pride club (I’m open to sponsor suggestions). Using this organization, the details of this project could be significantly refined. Furthermore, the environment would be conducive to ironing out any problems that may seep through this iron-clad plan as well as fundraising for various supplies. Recruiting would also be a lot easier. Just to be clear, I’d still like to form the club even if you somehow decide against approving the project; it would still be cool to come up with ways to prove to everyone what they already know: Seniors are the best.

                One of the most intimidating problems of the Chairy Project is how I would manage to remove the chairs in a quick, effective way. Over time, I’ve added on to my method, and it has reached a point of extreme efficiency. Firstly, I would have everyone (hopefully a large amount of people) gathered in a group outside the school, so I could assign duties and give instructions. Next, certain people in charge of their respective group(s) would receive walkie-talkies for better coordination. People would go through one room at a time and label the chairs with Post-It notes or duct tape or something with the number of the room it’ll be coming out of (possibly all at once or one smaller group doing it before the chairs are taken). Afterwards, the people would take the chairs out one or two doors (depending on how crowded it gets), and there would be at least one or two people who I would have briefed on where to put the chairs who would guide people to the correct destination. Depending on whether it’s found to be necessary, the chairs may be turned upside down or something in order to prevent them from toppling over and ending up in a place that they shouldn’t be. I would be constantly patrolling the group making sure everything runs smoothly (and probably helping too). Following the one day of glory, I would get everyone who helped take the chairs out to bring them back in: I know I’d have a harder time getting people to come back, but I think I could get the majority, and I’ll come back alone if I have to; it would still be worth it.

                Another thing that I’m sure tops your list of fears is how the chairs will be returned in the same condition as they left. Starting with the easier stuff, I’ll make sure that the Chairy Project is only done on a good-weather day; that way, water damage can be avoided, and the chairs get very little mud on them if at all. Also, on their way back into the school, the chairs can be checked and wiped of any dirt or bugs. In terms of vandalism, I have two ideas, and possibly more to come: Since one task of the Chairy Project would be fundraising, there would be the possibility of renting some sort of lockable storage containers. Another option would be to hire a few people (not students) to do a night watch to insure that no delinquents decide to take the project too far. With the help of a club of people to bounce ideas off of, I’m sure that a satisfactory solution can be found if you wouldn’t consider this one. If you’re worried about something happening while everyone is taking the chairs out (such as people writing inappropriate things on the classroom boards), I could have a small number of trustworthy people watch over the proceedings, and I would actually encourage you to be there so you could be put at ease and we could be sure that we’re doing everything right.

                Although it’s not really a problem, I feel that it’s necessary to tell you when I’d be thinking of carrying this out. Under my current plan, the chairs will be taken out the Sunday before the first Monday of April; if the weather is a problem, it would be consecutively moved to the next Sunday until there are favorable conditions. I picked this day for a few reasons: First, I picked April because it’s fairly late in the year (so the seniors can go out with a bang instead of anticlimactically start off with one), it gives the teachers ample time to prepare, it gives plenty of time for the project to be organized and refined, and it’s not so late in the year that it begins to interfere with testing. As for why I picked Monday, it allows people to see the fruits of their labor in all of their classes and there’s not usually much crucial going on in class like tests due to the shorter time period. The time, like everything else, is flexible, but that’s the current plan.

                If you’re worried about the feasibility of the Chairy Project, you can rest assured that I’ll make this work (or maybe that’s the thing you’re worried about). I can’t imagine any better way of ending my high school career than by pulling this off; you can’t really get any better than that. I will keep track of every problem, come up with solutions, run those solutions by you, and make sure that everything goes smoothly. There’s the saying, “When there’s a will, there’s a way,” and I have a lot of will. I know I can’t possibly give a solution to every concern you have about this project in this otherwise extremely well-written persuasive essay, but you don’t have to give your permission to go through with it right now: All I’m asking for is the chance to prove that I can pull it off. When stripped down to its simplest form, I don’t think the Chairy Project is all that malicious: Taking the chairs out of the classrooms doesn’t really pose much of an impediment to learning (although somewhat distracting), and since it would only be for one day, I think it wouldn’t be too bad of a light-hearted joke: It’s only the details that go along with the project which actually start raising concerns. If you still have concerns at the end of this (which you probably will), don’t use it a reason to shoot the whole thing down; tell me about it. I can only work on problems if I know about them, and I feel extremely confident that I’ll be able to some up with satisfactory solutions with plenty of time to spare. Furthermore, if I didn’t come up with solutions in time, it wouldn’t be like, “Oh, that stinks. Oh well,” and then go through with it anyway; if I don’t come up with solutions in time, I’ll shut the whole thing down myself, and you wouldn’t have anything to worry about. You have plenty of time to tell me that I can’t go through with this in the future, but there’s only so much time for me to begin setting things into motion. I’m only asking you to entertain the notion for the time being, so I can clean up anything that may still need work.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, I think the Chairy Project would be a very fun and nondestructive way for seniors to express themselves, and I hope that you give me the opportunity to show you such. You don’t have to approve me going through with it right now, just allow me to set things in motion, so I can prove to you that I can make it work. I know it would mean a lot to me, and I’m sure it would mean a lot to the class of 2016 as well.
