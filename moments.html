            One drawback of having applications with limited space is that many impactful events have to be overlooked in order to make room for the general questions that hopfully stumble across qualities that are reliable enough to determine whether a person should be admitted. In this page, I've condensed a lifetime of experiences into a relatively small number of moments which I consider the most important, whether the reason is practical (in terms of showing character building) or personal. Although this is probably one of the lengthiest sections of the website, I would say that the information contained within is some of the most integral to describing how I came to be the person that I am.
