            Important Moments
        </h1>
        <p>
            One drawback of having applications with limited space is that many impactful events have to be overlooked in order to make room for the general questions that hopfully stumble across qualities that are reliable enough to determine whether a person should be admitted. In this page, I've condensed a lifetime of experiences into a relatively small number of moments which I consider the most important, whether the reason is practical (in terms of showing character building) or personal. Although this is probably one of the lengthiest sections of the website, I would say that the information contained within is some of the most integral to describing how I came to be the person that I am.

            <p>
                In elementary school, I was in a gifted program called Spectra. We did many things, but among them were many presentations and skits. Working on the stuff wasn't too bad and could even be enjoyable, but when the end product was needed and the spotlight was on me, the dred set in. I didn't like getting up in front of people and having the pressure be put one me even if it was just with a few people (most of the time).
