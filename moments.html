            Important Moments
        </h1>
        <p>
            One drawback of having applications with limited space (not to mention the tiny amount MIT has) is that many impactful events have to be overlooked in order to make room for the general questions that hopfully stumble across qualities that are reliable enough to determine whether a person should be admitted. In this page, I've condensed a lifetime of experiences into a relatively small number of moments which I consider the most important, whether the reason is practical (in terms of showing character building) or personal. Although there are large parts missing, I would say that the information contained within is (or more like will be) some of the most integral to describing how I came to be the person that I am.

                Origin of Mental Discipline

            <p>
                In elementary school, I was in a gifted program called Spectra. We did many things, but among them were many presentations and skits. Working on the stuff wasn't too bad and could even be enjoyable, but when the end product was needed and the spotlight was on me, the dred set in. I didn't like getting up in front of people and having the pressure be put one me even if it was just with a few people (most of the time).

                I've never been the most outgoing person, but when I started high school after moving, my quietness caused me to go an entire year without really making any friends. I felt so lonely, and it was particularly awful because I knew I was causing it. It wasn't until my second year of high school that someone, let's call her Jane Doe, finally worked at getting to know me long enough that we became friends. We got along really well, and eventually we became more than friends. However, over time, differences between us accumulated, and she soon decided that more than friends was too much. I was somewhat upset, but I could understand, and she said we could still be friends even though it turned out being a lie. While it was still fairly true, though, I reached out to Jane to help me through the sudden reintroduction to the terribly lonely life I'd had before. Despite my obvious difficulty handling the situation, it was made quite clear over the course of our conversation that I was on my own. I had to decide if I was going to go back to making myself miserable or if I was going to finally work up the courage to be more talkative like a normal person. Through means that still aren't quite clear to me, I found it within myself to do the latter. I'm NEVER going to allow myself to become that lonely again.

                For as long as I can remember, I've never been the most outgoing person around: I'd generally be quiet, speak when spoken to, and feel awkward easily. Once I got to know people better, those behaviors would dissipate, but it would take a long time. Although I would be somewhat lonely for a little while depending on the circumstances, my quietness never significantly affected me until I started high school (after moving). For some reason, unlike when I moved before starting middle school, I didn't magically make friends this time. People were nice, and I didn't particularly notice being extra quiet, but I went an entire year without really making any friends. I felt so lonely, and it was particularly awful because I knew I was the one bringing this loneliness upon myself.

                It wasn't until my second year of high school that someone, let's call them Jane Doe, finally worked at getting to know me long enough that we became friends. We got along really well, and eventually we became more than friends. (And I want to make sure that you know it wasn't just because she was my only option; we really did get along quite well.) I was very happy with Jane and wasn't the least bit lonely; however, over time, differences between us began to accumulate, and she soon decided that more than friends was too much. I was somewhat upset, but I could understand, and she said we could still be friends even though it turned out being a lie.

                While it was still fairly true, though, I found myself not being able to make up for all of the conversations I didn't have with other people anymore, and I was faced with returning to the terrible loneliness I had experienced for so long before. I reached out to Jane to help me through it, but throughout the course of our conversation, it was made quite clear that I was on my own. I had to decide if I was going to go back to making myself miserable or if I was going to finally work up the courage to talk to people like a normal person. Through means that still aren't quite clear to me, I found it within myself to do the latter. I'm never, ever, <strong><em><ins>ever</ins></em></strong> going to allow myself to become that lonely again.
