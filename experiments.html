                For the longest time, I had been suspecting that I was talking to more girls than boys. I would always try to treat everyone equally, but I couldn't shake the feeling that things weren't quite equal. I thought it could be all in my head, but then again, maybe it wasn't, and if so, was it caused by me or other people? After driving myself crazy going back and forth forever, I decided to finally get scientific about it and collect some data pertaining to female versus male interactions (excluding adults). The results are detailed below.

                This is how much sleep I've been getting starting on the night between January 29, 2017 and January 30, 2017. The days of the week refer to the day I wake up after getting the amount of sleep described in that column. The starting time for my sleep may or may not come from the day before. Most of the times are exact (right before I get into bed), but a few are approximations likely within 10 minutes. I might have missed a few naps earlier on.
