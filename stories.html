                The Happy Birthday song
            </h2>
            <p>
                Every once in a while during my time in high school band, someone's birthday would come around and we would play the Happy Birthday song for them. There was only one problem: No one actually knew how to play the Happy Birthday song. Whenever we were called upon to play the song, we basically just played random notes that we hoped were kind-of close to the real tune. (Our main teacher liked calling it Happy Birthday in Z flat.) This had bothered me for some time, but when I asked for music for the Happy Birthday song to be handed out so we could play it correctly, I was told that they didn't have the music. Not content with believing that there was no way for us to play the song correctly, I would occasionally bring up the subject again, insisting that there had to be some way of getting the music to such a common song. During senior year, after repeated failures of requests for action, I decided to take matters into my own hands: This time, instead of asking for the music to be procured for me, I asked if the music would be handed out if I made it myself. Since that required very little effort on the teachers' part, it was agreed, and I was told about a free music composing program that I could use (<a href="https://musescore.org/">MuseScore</a>). For well over a month, I labored away at creating two parts of music for every single instrument in the band. I had hoped to finish before my birthday, but circumstances prohibited it; the Happy Birthday song for my birthday was played in the key of Z flat. After an immense learning curve, problems at every turn, and absolutely no help from the band teachers (despite how I requested it), I finally finished the music and it was handed out... only to first-hour band. Even though the music was eventually printed up, the band teachers just couldn't manage to hand it out for second-hour band; it wasn't until I came into school early one day, set up all of the chairs for second-hour band, and put a sheet of music generally corresponding to the instrument of the person who would sit there that second-hour finally had the ability to play the Happy Birthday song. As a result of this ordeal, during our last concert of the year when the seniors are recognized, the band teachers acted like they forgot about me.
